<h3>Overview and Features</h3>
OVPN-Alt is an open source alternative to OpenVPN-AS (Access Server). Currently, it's under development. Features I plan to add are:
```
	Admin Features:
	
	Install OpenVPN ✓
	Uninstall OpenVPN ✓
	Add users ✓
	Remove users ✓
	Timed removal of users
	Multiple VPN servers (one host, multiple slaves) || Sorta done
	Change OpenVPN configuration
                                


	User Features:
	
	Change password
	...I can't think of anymore



	Also, I may add support to install and/or manage PPTP and L2TP.

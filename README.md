<h3>Overview and Features</h3>
OVPN-Alt is an open source alternative to OpenVPN-AS (Access Server). Currently, it's under development. Features I plan to add are:
                                <u>Admin</u>
                                Install OpenVPN ✓
                                Uninstall OpenVPN ✓
                                Add users
                                Remove users
                                Timed removal of users
                                Multiple VPN servers (one host, multiple slaves)
                                Change OpenVPN configuration
                                


                                 <u>User</u>
                                 Change password
                                 ...I can't think of anymore



                       Also, I may add support to install and/or manage PPTP and L2TP.

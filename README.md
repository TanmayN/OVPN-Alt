<h3>OVPN-Alt</h3>
OVPN-Alt is an open source alternative to OpenVPN-AS (Access Server). Currently, it's under development. Features I plan to add are:

                                Install OpenVPN âœ“
                                Add users
                                Remove users
                                Timed removal of users
                                Multiple VPN servers (one host, multiple slaves)
                                Change OpenVPN configuration
                        
                       Also, I may add support to install and/or manage PPTP and L2TP.
